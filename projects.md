## @ DSYH - Don't Scratch Your Head

DSYH came up with such a good idea.

When it comes to work, fucked work I did @ **DSYH** and I was not alone working there, so I need to give credits to other guys also. We were doing the fucked work @ **DSYH**.

Here I learned about python and at the end NodeJS, came to know about redis, RabbitMQ, pub-sub and Celery (I haven't used Celery but I know Celery will do its part amazingly). 

**And I am onto Data solution now, because it solves problem** but confused between nodeJS and python (God help me). 

### And I am responsible for

* **Present Shipping** - To know what is present shipping, you need to have some details about **DSYH** first. 

* **Inventory Sync** - This is the amazing thing, I love this. When you are selling on multiple market places, you must be worried about stock management. This is the solution. 

	If you are seller and reading this go for services of **DSYH**.

* **Generating reports** - From here I want to go for Data Solution and want to learn data solution. We were providing reports of how many products were sold?, which products were making highest profit?, on which products you are making too much expenses? on which products marketplaces are taking too much charges? 
	
	That bla bla bla bla... 

	**DSYH** must concentrate more on this.

* **And a new System** - Ohh I am also involved in migrating :). We were migrating old system to new system. We replaced php, java, python and MySQL with NodeJS, python and MongoDB. From so long long scripts, we made scripts smaller using configs. And mongoDB really helped us. 

	Whether it is about reading a csv/excel file and inserting into database, or whether it is about scrapping/crawling marketplaces for some data. We have used configs, that we are storing into Mongo. 

	We will get into deeper later.

## @ Wittybee PVT LTD

Such an amazing product. A product like jeera and asana are much complex to use but Wittybee is very handy and addicted.

Here I learned about how to write a code and coding standard, I learned C# & C++ here and came to know about how to work with DLL and events programming with async behaviour. I came to know that windows app development is very much difficult. My personal advice : don't go for windows app development.

I was involved in developing MAPI for Wittybee desktop app. OOP that I have learned in books, had seen implemented here.

## Other Projects

### Bridge - a card based game @ DAIICT.

  Bridge is a card based game, only one which is authorized by Indian government. As an internship project, we were working on this. We have worked on Duplicate Bridge Movement - a type of a Bridge game.

  We developed card based multiplayer game, on which users can play game on LAN. On one table there are 4 sittings and 100 players can play simultaneously with our app. We have contributed to networking part and game logics.

  Reason I am talking about here is, I learned networking concepts, TCP & UDP protocol, how to work with sockets and QT-c++ framework with XML and javascript.
   
### DAIICT - an android app for DAIICT.

   Here we learned about how to work in a TEAM - a team of 11 members. Requirement is much  complicated but useful for institution like DAIICT. Purpose of this app, students need to keep checking mails about events and lectures, so with this app when there is something that needs to broadcast, admin can give notifications with this app. Admin needs to manage vacate rooms and committee gets irritated to ask for vacate rooms, so this app helped to resolved this.

   This app is developed for 3 different users,
   1. Student body governement and Committee
   2. Admins
   3. Students
